7.  Q: about innodb table structure?
    A: dict_table_t -
                    --> dict_foreign_t -
                    |                  --> dict_index_t 
                    |
                    --> dict_index_t -
                                     --> dict_field_t -
                                                      --> dict_col_t


8. Q: how to alloct page in segment?
   A: the first 32 pages of a segment are allocated from 'fragment extent',
      where any individual page can be allocated. after that, a segment always
      reserves the whole 64 page extents.

9. Q: how do innodb execute read-ahead both sequential and random?
   A: if do sequential read-ahead, it will read next 64 pages extent. maybe
      block other read util the whole extent be read.
      Random read-ahead means that when InnoDB notices that if at least 13
      pages in an extent have been accessed very recently, then InnoDB reads
      in all the rest of the pages in the extent.

10. Q: how does innodb to reuse the free space?
    A: Free space can always be recycled within a segment. A segment can
    release free space to other segments, if a 64 page extent becomes totally
    empty, and also it can release individual pages from its 32 fragment
    extent pages.

11. Q: how to create mysql trace file? 
    A: debug = t:T:n:o,/tmp/mysqld.trace

12. Q: when and how to use the information_schema tables?

       if this is the show commands. first calling prepare_schema_table() -> make_schema_select() to change
       the show commands to select commands.
	   
13. Q: when are the information_schema tables filled? 
    A: for each command ,the information_schema table is dynamic filled . detail see: information_schema plugin
       and sql/sql_show.* files.
