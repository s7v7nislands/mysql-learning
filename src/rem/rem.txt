/*          PHYSICAL RECORD (OLD STYLE)
            ===========================

The physical record, which is the data type of all the records
found in index pages of the database, has the following format
(lower addresses and more significant bits inside a byte are below
represented on a higher text line):

| offset of the end of the last field of data, the most significant
  bit is set to 1 if and only if the field is SQL-null,
  if the offset is 2-byte, then the second most significant
  bit is set to 1 if the field is stored on another page:
  mostly this will occur in the case of big BLOB fields |
...
| offset of the end of the first field of data + the SQL-null bit |
| 4 bits used to delete mark a record, and mark a predefined
  minimum record in alphabetical order |
| 4 bits giving the number of records owned by this record
  (this term is explained in page0page.h) |
| 13 bits giving the order number of this record in the
  heap of the index page |
| 10 bits giving the number of fields in this record |
| 1 bit which is set to 1 if the offsets above are given in
  one byte format, 0 if in two byte format |
| two bytes giving an absolute pointer to the next record in the page |
ORIGIN of the record
| first field of data |
...
| last field of data |

The origin of the record is the start address of the first field
of data. The offsets are given relative to the origin.
The offsets of the data fields are stored in an inverted
order because then the offset of the first fields are near the
origin, giving maybe a better processor cache hit rate in searches.

The offsets of the data fields are given as one-byte
(if there are less than 127 bytes of data in the record)
or two-byte unsigned integers. The most significant bit
is not part of the offset, instead it indicates the SQL-null
if the bit is set to 1. */


/*          PHYSICAL RECORD (NEW STYLE)
            ===========================

The physical record, which is the data type of all the records
found in index pages of the database, has the following format
(lower addresses and more significant bits inside a byte are below
represented on a higher text line):

| length of the last non-null variable-length field of data:
  if the maximum length is 255, one byte; otherwise,
  0xxxxxxx (one byte, length=0..127), or 1exxxxxxxxxxxxxx (two bytes,
  length=128..16383, extern storage flag) |
...
| length of first variable-length field of data |
| SQL-null flags (1 bit per nullable field), padded to full bytes |
| 4 bits used to delete mark a record, and mark a predefined
  minimum record in alphabetical order |
| 4 bits giving the number of records owned by this record
  (this term is explained in page0page.h) |
| 13 bits giving the order number of this record in the
  heap of the index page |
| 3 bits record type: 000=conventional, 001=node pointer (inside B-tree),
  010=infimum, 011=supremum, 1xx=reserved |
| two bytes giving a relative pointer to the next record in the page |

| first field of data |

/* CANONICAL COORDINATES. A record can be seen as a single
string of 'characters' in the following way: catenate the bytes
in each field, in the order of fields. An SQL-null field
is taken to be an empty sequence of bytes. Then after
the position of each field insert in the string
the 'character' <FIELD-END>, except that after an SQL-null field
insert <NULL-FIELD-END>. Now the ordinal position of each
byte in this canonical string is its canonical coordinate.
So, for the record ("AA", SQL-NULL, "BB", ""), the canonical
string is "AA<FIELD_END><NULL-FIELD-END>BB<FIELD-END><FIELD-END>".
We identify prefixes (= initial segments) of a record
with prefixes of the canonical string. The canonical
length of the prefix is the length of the corresponding
prefix of the canonical string. The canonical length of
a record is the length of its canonical string.

For example, the maximal common prefix of records
("AA", SQL-NULL, "BB", "C") and ("AA", SQL-NULL, "B", "C")
is "AA<FIELD-END><NULL-FIELD-END>B", and its canonical
length is 5.

A complete-field prefix of a record is a prefix which ends at the
end of some field (containing also <FIELD-END>).
A record is a complete-field prefix of another record, if
the corresponding canonical strings have the same property. */


OLD STYLE OFFSET ARRAY:
uint offsets[]
offsets[0] = n_alloc        // the size of the array
offsets[1] = n_fields       // field number of the index in this rec

rec_offs_base(offsets) = offsets + 2
rec_offs_base(offsets)[0] = REC_N_OLD_EXTRA_BYTES + offset fields  // REC_N_OLD_EXTRA_BYTES = 6, include field offset.

rec_offs_base(offsets)[1] = offset of field[0]      // 31 bit: IS_NULL, 30 bit: IS_STORED_EXTERNAL
         ...
         ...
         ...
rec_offs_base(offsets)[n_fields] = offset of field[n_fields-1]



NEW STYLE OFFSET ARRAY:
uint offsets[]
offsets[0] = n_alloc        // the size of the array
offsets[1] = n_fields       // field number of the index in this rec

rec_offs_base(offsets) = offsets + 2
rec_offs_base(offsets)[0] = size of extra record header + offset + nullable
fields | REC_OFFS_COMPACT | REC_OFFS_EXTERNAL   // include field offset and
null bits, REC_OFFS_EXTERNAL 只有在leaf中才可能有

rec_offs_base(offsets)[1] = offset of field[0]      // 31 bit: IS_NULL, 30 bit: IS_STORED_EXTERNAL
         ...
         ...
         ...
rec_offs_base(offsets)[n_fields] = offset of field[n_fields-1]



note:
1. the record format of no leaf node and leaf node are different. 
   in no leaf node: uniq fields + node pointer.
   in leaf node: uniq fields + all other fields

2. the no leaf node have a bit mark predefined minimum record in alphabetical order.
3. B-tree node pointers must not contain externally stored columns.  Thus the "e" flag must be 0.
   在old格式中没有说明到底允不允许。见rec_init_offsets()

4. old格式可以从rec直接构造出来offsets,new格式需要dict_index_t才能构造。
5. new格式中nullable字段可以没有。这里nulls的-1，在没有nullable的时候不会运行到。
6. old格式中fixed的field的null的filed用\x00来填充
7. comp格式的rec对不同的status(REC_STATUS_*)有不同的处理, 内部节点dict_index_get_n_unique_in_tree(index) + 1
8. comp格式中2字节的offset，低在前，高在后(LLHH)
9. rec_t表示物理记录，dtuple_t表示解析后的记录
