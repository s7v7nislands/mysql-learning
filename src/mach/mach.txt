/*************************************************************
Writes a ulint in a compressed form where the first byte codes the
length of the stored ulint. We look at the most significant bits of
the byte. If the most significant bit is zero, it means 1-byte storage,
else if the 2nd bit is 0, it means 2-byte storage, else if 3rd is 0,
it means 3-byte storage, else if 4th is 0, it means 4-byte storage,
else the storage is 5-byte. */

note：
1. 主要用于转换平台无关的存储格式。
2. 其中有些函数用压缩算法来减小存储空间。
